# DevPortfolio-in-React
This is my profile to highlight my development projects using React.

This project is an application coded with React, REACTDOM, and inititated with Vite. In this application you'll get a brief introduction to who I am, some samples of development projects I've worked on, accompanied by links to the corresponding GitHub repositories, a link to my resume, and a form to contact me. Though the form is currently in it's initial stages and submitted responses are not sent anywhere.

## Contributions

I received assistance from the Xpert Learning Assistant tool available through my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp account. This tool helped guide me through some difficulties, including error handling, conditional logic (mainly with Contact form functionality), evaluating code quality, and for loops to help code the Project and Portfolio compoments. In addition, I found this tutorial extremely helpful when learning more about the concept of nav and header lists. [React Navbar and Header Component | Tutorial-Hadyn Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwgdzwNYico). 

I also received assistance from my tutor for this project (name can be noted once permission is granted) to guide me through logic of implementing the Project component correctly within the Portfolio component, and from E Kathuria who helped me polish up the styling of the site.
